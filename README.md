===================

Development of support for Yaesu FT-2900R in CHIRP

For more information on CHIRP see http://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home

I am at the beginning stage of writing a driver for the FT-2900R.  I would like to buy this transceiver, but don't want to
buy any 2 meter rig that can't be programmed by CHIRP.  Anybody with developer experience please feel free to post, 
especially if you also own the rig.
